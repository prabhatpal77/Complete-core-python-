Magic method:-
            Any method name which is starts with __ and ends with __ is known as a magic method. Magic method
            object of a class will be executed automatically whenever corresponding event is generated.
            __init__()
            __del__()
            __str__()
            __add__()
            for every operator corresponding magic method is defining in python.
            When operators related magic methods are defining inside the class those operators we can apply in
            that perticular class object.
            Because of implementing every operator throw magic method the behaviour of the operator is dynamic.
